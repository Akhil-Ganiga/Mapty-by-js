Mapty is a web-based application that allows users to track their workouts and view them on a map. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Mapty provides features for recording different types of workouts, such as running, cycling, or hiking. Users can input workout details, including distance, duration, and location, and the application displays the workout on an interactive map. JavaScript handles the logic for capturing user input, integrating with mapping APIs like Leaflet or Google Maps, and rendering workout data on the map. Mapty helps users track their fitness progress, visualize their workout routes, and explore new exercise locations.
